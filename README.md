# :truck: Snow Boarder

Basic DHL training guide - grab box - dropkick it - deliver it
Not really a full game just some simple pick-up and drop off mechanics while driving a cool car

## :keyboard: How to use

- Arrow keys to drive :car:
- Pick up the red Squares :b:
- Deliver to red Circle :red_circle:
- Boost on the Blue Triangles :arrow_up_small:

## :camera_flash: Caught in (almost) 4K
This was my first dabble with Unity to familiarize myself with the interface
